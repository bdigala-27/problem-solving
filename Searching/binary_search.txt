Standard Binary Search
    Search for an element in a sorted array or list
    Repeatedly divide the search interval in half
Binary Search on Sorted Rotated Array
    Array is sorted but rotated at some pivot point
    Find the pivot point first
    Apply standard binary search on the two sorted subarrays
Binary Search with Duplicates
    Sorted array or list with duplicate elements
    Handle duplicates properly for correctness
Closest Element in Sorted Array
    Find the element closest to a given target value
    Narrow down the search interval using binary search
    Compare the target value with the closest elements
Search in Infinite Sorted Array
    Search in a sorted array or list of infinite size (or very large)
    Find the search interval using a modified binary search approach
    Apply standard binary search on the search interval
Search in Sorted Matrix
    Search for an element in a sorted 2D matrix
    Combine binary search techniques on rows and columns
Search in Sorted 2D Array
    Sorted 2D array, sorted row-wise and column-wise
    Combine binary search on rows and columns
Search in Sorted Array of Unknown Size
    Size of the sorted array or list is unknown
    Determine the search interval while searching for the target
Search in Bitonic Array
    Array first sorted in ascending order, then descending order
    Find the peak element using a modified binary search
    Search the ascending and descending subarrays separately
Search in Sorted Linked List
    Search for an element in a sorted linked list
    Use a modified binary search with "slow" and "fast" pointers
